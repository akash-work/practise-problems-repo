This problem has been taken from Hacker earth practise problems:

Little Shino loves maths. Today her teacher gave her two integers. 
Shino is now wondering how many integers can divide both the numbers. 
She is busy with her assignments. Help her to solve the problem.

Input:
First line of the input file contains two integers, a and b

Output:
Print the number of common factors of a and b


Constraints: 1<=a,b<=pow(10,12)


Editorial

Brief Description: Given two integers a and b, find the number of factors common to both a and b.


Solution: First we will obtain the GCD of these numbers and then obtain the factors of the acquired GCD
